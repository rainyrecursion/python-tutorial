# Python Tutorial

## IDLE Basics

When you open IDLE, you will see a window with something like this:

```python
Python 3.7.4 (tags/v3.7.4:e09359112e, Jul  8 2019, 20:34:20) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license()" for more information.
>>> 
```

(Might be slightly different e.g. version number may be different)

This is called **Interactive mode**. If you want to type some quick code (e.g. do some quick Math calculation, test out how some function* works), you can do it here.

*\* Don't worry if you don't know what a function is yet, we'll get to that later.*

For example,

```python
>>> 123 + 456
579
```

We will mainly be using **Script mode**, which basically involves us creating and editing a Python code file (.py).

It works similar to Microsoft Word:

* To make a new file, go to "File" > "New File" or press Ctrl + N.
* To open a file, go to "File" > "Open File" or press Ctrl + O.
* To save a file, go to "File" > "Save" or press Ctrl + S.
